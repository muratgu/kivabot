# kivabot
A python script that makes a $25 kiva loan everytime it runs, if there is enough credit.

To run, simply type:
>python kivabot.py [uid] [pwd]

You can run it scheduled so that payed loans can be recycled automatically.

If you have [python twitter command line tool](http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/) installed, it will tweet to your account when it successfully makes a loan.
